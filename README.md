# Movie Recommendation System

## Description
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using data from TMDB (The Movie Database). used csv files to collect movie data, which is then preprocessed using Python Pandas. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied for text vectorization, and machine learning models are trained using Scikit-learn for accurate movie recommendations. The project also integrates TMDB API to fetch movie posters and provides a user-friendly interface through a Streamlit app. Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn is utilized for insightful analysis of movie features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- TMDB API
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and manipulation using Pandas
- Text vectorization using NLTK for NLP-based feature representation
- Training machine learning models with Scikit-learn for accurate recommendations
- Integration of TMDB API to fetch movie posters
- User-friendly interface provided through a Streamlit app
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful analysis

## Usage
1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the main script `recommendation_system.py` to scrape movie data, preprocess it, train the models, and start the Streamlit app.
3. Access the recommendation system through the provided URL in the console.
4. Interact with the app to get personalized movie recommendations based on your preferences.

## Conclusion
This movie recommendation system showcases the use of web scraping, data preprocessing, NLP, machine learning, API integration, and data visualization techniques. It provides accurate and personalized movie recommendations to enhance the user experience. The project can be further extended by incorporating additional features or deploying it on a cloud platform for wider accessibility.
